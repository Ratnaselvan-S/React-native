first project i am going to build is businesscard 

then here i am going to build it using 


        "npx create-expo-app@latest --template"


        npx runs locally and used to execute the package 

        create-expo-app is just the package and "@latest" is used to download the current version of the package and then 

        --template is used to download the package with just blank ,or blank typescript
