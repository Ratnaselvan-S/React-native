first project i am going to build is businesscard 

then here i am going to build it using 


        "npx  create-expo-app@latest --template"


        npx runs locally and used to execute the package 

        create-expo-app is just the package and "@latest" is used to download the current version of the package and then 

        --template is used to download the package with just blank ,or blank typescript


Here i did nothing just "view" is div in web and for "p" "text" in app and img as "Image"

In image aspect ratio is nothing but adjust based on screen size and also on width for every 16px the aspect ratio of height
increases on 9px 


font awesome @expo/vector-icons this is built in default package of icons in expo


Button is an component and onpress we can put console.warn

then if we need to mail we can use Linking from react native || Linking.openURL("mailto:ratnaselvan.iqtechmax@gmail.com");


safeareaview only works on ios which is built in react native  

i think for android we need to import third party libraries to implement on 


npx expo install react-native-safe-area-context this is the command to install the safe area one 
here we use npx expo it is same as npm install but the key difference is that we will install the package which has support to the 
current vesion of expo we are using
